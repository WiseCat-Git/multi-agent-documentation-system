# Multi-Agent Documentation System

**A collaborative AI documentation generator powered by CrewAI**

## Overview

This project implements a multi-agent AI system for automated documentation generation using CrewAI. Four specialized AI agents work together sequentially to research, write, review, and create training materials from user input. The system provides a Streamlit web interface for easy interaction and supports multiple documentation formats.

### Agent Architecture

The system employs four specialized agents:

1. **Researcher Agent** - Gathers information, analyzes context, and identifies key features
2. **Documentation Specialist Agent** - Transforms research into structured, professional documentation
3. **Quality Reviewer Agent** - Reviews for accuracy, completeness, and clarity
4. **Training Specialist Agent** - Converts documentation into learning materials and onboarding guides

## Features

- Multi-agent collaborative workflow with sequential task processing
- Multiple documentation templates (Technical docs, Meeting minutes, Reports, API docs, User guides, Project proposals)
- File upload support (DOCX, PDF, CSV, Excel)
- Clean Streamlit web interface with real-time progress tracking
- Export to DOCX format with proper formatting
- Configurable LLM models and temperature settings

## Customization

### Modifying Agent Behavior

Edit `main.py` to customize agent roles, goals, and backstories:

```python
researcher = Agent(
    role='Your Custom Role',
    goal='Your custom goal',
    backstory='Your custom backstory',
    llm=llm,
    verbose=True
)
```

### Adding New Templates

Edit the template list in `app.py`:

```python
template = st.sidebar.selectbox(
    "Choose Documentation Template",
    [
        "Your New Template",
        # ... existing templates
    ]
)
```

### Changing LLM Model

Edit `main.py` to use different models:

```python
llm = ChatOpenAI(
    model="gpt-4",  # Options: gpt-4, gpt-4-turbo, gpt-3.5-turbo
    temperature=0.7
)
```

## Cost Considerations

### Estimated Costs Per Generation

- **gpt-4o-mini** (default): $0.05-$0.15
- **gpt-4**: $0.30-$0.80
- **gpt-3.5-turbo**: $0.01-$0.03

### Cost Optimization Tips

- Use gpt-3.5-turbo for simple documentation
- Reserve gpt-4 for complex, critical documentation
- Implement caching for repeated queries
- Set token limits per agent
- Monitor usage through OpenAI dashboard

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"OPENAI_API_KEY not found"**
- Verify `.env` file exists in project root
- Ensure API key is properly formatted
- Restart the Streamlit application

**"Module not found" errors**
- Verify virtual environment is activated
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Check Python version (3.9+)

**Slow performance**
- This is expected behavior for multi-agent systems
- Consider using faster models (gpt-3.5-turbo)
- Simplify input complexity
- Check internet connection speed

**Poor output quality**
- Provide more detailed input
- Adjust temperature settings
